              <p id="localP2"> Keep Virginia Beautiful is just one of the many organizations available that you can get involved with to help make a positive change against littering in Virginia. KVB has been helping to lead the fight against littering in Virginia since the 1950s, when they saw Virginia roadways becoming a dumping ground for trash and debris. Since then, KBV has been leading the charge against littering in Virginia by hosting events, educating the populace, petitioning the state government, and reaching out to local businesses to help get them involved. KVB has championed this long historical fight against littering into the modern era and continues offering many opportunities and events for residents to get involved (see side bars for details). Consider joining KVBâ€™s long historical fight against littering in the commonwealth and make a change that will help positively impact both you and future generations. </p>
