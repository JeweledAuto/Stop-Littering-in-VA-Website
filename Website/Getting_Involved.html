                <p id="involved2"> Getting involved and taking action against littering in your community helps empower you to maintain your community's ecosystem and visual appeal and protects both local residents and wildlife. Keeping your local habitat free of litter will help prevent harmful and potentially deadly effects domestic pets and local wildlife can experience when consuming many of the toxic products littering leaves in the environment. In addition, getting involved in the cleanup process helps prevent harmful chemicals from litter leeching into the soil and water, causing harm and contamination in both local water sources and plants.</p>

This compounding change helps turn small lifestyle changes into community and state-wide transformations that will help redefine and protect the residents, habitat, and wildlife for decades to come. </p>
