            <h2><b><u> Enviromental Issues of Littering </u></b></h2>
            <p> Littering leads to harmful chemicals and pollutants saturating into local water and soil, damaging local ecosystems and affecting both indigenous plants and aquatic life. In addition, improperly disposed of trash can be eaten by and possibly harm both domestic and wild animals, causing an additional financial burden on both residents and local government. The last major area of concern littering produces is the risk of fires. As more and more trash and debris pile up throughout town and the state, the chance of fires starting and quickly spreading grows larger, creating potential health and safety as well as economic risks and concerns. </p>
            <h3><b><u> Financial Costs of Littering </u></b></h3>
            <p> When waste is not disposed of in the proper channels, it falls on the local and state governmental agencies to fund clean-up programs and employ additional labor to go through the task of cleaning up all the individual waste littering spread throughout the state, costing taxpayers money and wasting local governmental energy. </p>
            <h4><b><u> Litterings Impact on Visual Appeal </u></b></h4>
            <p id="pBottom"> As littering has ramped up over the years, visual pollution has become more and more common throughout the state. You would be hard-pressed to walk or drive more than a minute without encountering or seeing grassy mediums, street walkways, or roadside curbs cluttered with random debris. This loss of visual appeal negatively affects local property value and dramatically reduces vacation traffic and state growth, negatively impacting the local economy and leading to a lack of state beauty and pride. </p>
